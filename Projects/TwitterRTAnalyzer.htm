                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        This retweet- and reply-based Twitter activity scanner was purpose built for my Dad. He wished for a tool for finding tweets from like-minded people and sort them based on how active and popular they are. This program does this in a rudimentary way by gathering users from the search results and checking how many replies and retweets they make.<br /><br />

                        I intend to make it smarter in the future. At this time, I only use several lists of dictionaries, populate them and repopulate them before sorting them. While scanning thousands of tweets, it is very slow. I intend to implement more advanced data structures at some point. I may also experiment with a GUI.
                    </p>
                    <h2>For the curious</h2>
                        <p><b>Learning objectives:</b> I did not put too much thought into efficient data structures and algorithms for this project. I focused on learning the required authentication processes that go behind programs like this. I spent a good while trying to implement Oauth by hand. I attempted to communicate with the Twitter API directly by getting the request keys and then access keys and whatnot. But it didn't work out. So I resorted to using rauth for the authentication. I learned a huge amount in this process.<br /><br />

                        <b>How it works:</b> It uses the PIN method for Twitter authentication at first use. rauth handles the Oauth dance, the user is prompted to browse to a URL and use a PIN code to log in. Their access keys are saved for later use in a config file so they don't have to log in again. At this time, the program does three things using the user's authentication:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It searches Twitter for requested keywords.</li>
                            <li>It builds a database of all users that show up in results (as tweeters and users in search) and the number of their followers.</li>
                            <li>It scans up to 200 of their latest tweets and calculates the percentage of retweets and replies in them.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
