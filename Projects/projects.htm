It adds a toolbar button that uploads an open gif to gfycat, an online service that compresses it and converts it to HTML5 video.

There is a version of this integrated into the undo (Cmd+Z) functionality in Safari, but it only opens one tab and doesn't always work. RecoverTabs lets you intuitively reopen multiple tabs.</p></a>
