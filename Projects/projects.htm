                    <a href="./redditbots.htm"><p><b>reddit bots</b><br /> I have experimented a bit with Python scripts that autonomously post on reddit. reddit bots are common. Some are merely funny while some have utility. I have made one bot of the former kind and have some ideas for making some of the other.</p></a>

It adds a toolbar button that instantly uploads an open gif to gfycat, an online service that compresses it and converts it to HTML5 video. Thus, painfully slow loading gifs are played back much quicker with one click.</p></a>

It was written completely by hand. The only tools I used were Sublime Text and browser developer tools. I have tried my best to make it work well across browsers and platforms. It currently uses the about.me API and is hosted on Amazon S3.</p></a>
